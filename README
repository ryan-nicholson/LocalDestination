## What is #Doughlicious?

Doughlicious is a platform for users to place orders for pizzas that are then received by the shop.  It allows for seamless employee management and has a built-in system differentiating customer and employee orders.

## How does it work?

Doughlicious takes advantage of the built-in ApplicationUser in .net framework, and ties that to our customized user class, then differentiates the users by type.  Based on type the User will have access to different functionalities, whether that be adding employees, creating and editing orders, creating or deleting pizzas and more.

## But who is it for?
